# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Customer Analysis
Case study for the completion of Google Data Analyst specialization on Coursera

The Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across a network of 692 stations in Chicago. Cyclisticâ€™s current marketing strategy relied on building awareness and appealing to a broader audience. They appeal to these consumer segments with their flexible pricing plans: single-ride pass, full-day pass, and annual memberships.

Finance analysts have concluded they the annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno the director of marketing concludes that future success depends on maximizing annual memberships. She believes that there is a very good chance to convert casual riders to annual members since they are already aware of and use the service. Moreno and her team are interested in insights that could help design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members.

The Task
Provide insights that would help the marketing team design a new strategy that would convert casual riders to annual members

Find differences and similarities in how casual members and annual riders use the service
