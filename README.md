# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Customer Analysis
Case study for the completion of Google Data Analyst specialization on Coursera

The Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across a network of 692 stations in Chicago. Cyclisticâ€™s current marketing strategy relied on building awareness and appealing to a broader audience. They appeal to these consumer segments with their flexible pricing plans: single-ride pass, full-day pass, and annual memberships.

Finance analysts have concluded they the annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno the director of marketing concludes that future success depends on maximizing annual memberships. She believes that there is a very good chance to convert casual riders to annual members since they are already aware of and use the service. Moreno and her team are interested in insights that could help design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual members.

## The Data

The Data used in this analysis is found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) in csv format. The analysis uses data available from the last year (Jan-Dec 2021). The data used has fields for ride id, type of bike used, start and end datetime for usage, start and end station id and name, start and end longitude and latitude, and the user type. I started by loading the packages in Rstudio: tidyverse, lubricate, ggplot2. 

## The Process
I then loaded the csv files for each month, and checked the consistency of the data structure between the csv files using str and colnames function. Thankfully the files were formatted consistently, which means I can now join them into one dataframe using bind_rows for ease. Before exploring the the binded dataframe I looked at the data as a whole to see if anything stands out. I saw few NA and then reomved them with drop_na function. 

I first created a new column callled ride_length using the started_at and ended_at columns, and then looked at the mean, median, minimum and, maximum to get a bigger picture of the data. I saw that the minimum of the ride length returned a negative result, This might be becasue of bike returns/refunds, I decided not to include these in the analysis and removed negatives from the dataframe. Next, I then looked athe the mean, median, minimum and, maximum again, but this time seperating the annual members and casual users for comparison. I also seperated the date into day of the week, months and, day to compare how the two user type use Cyclistic on average in their daily life. 

## The Analysis
According to the analysis Casual users uses Cyclistic services longer than Annual Members
